Hi! I'm Srideep Dornala and I'm a second year computer science major here at UC San Diego. I'm interested in all things computer science, but I'm especially interested in the algorithmic side.

## Projects I've Built:

1. **ProtegAI** - A website that uses finetuned LLMs and classifiers along with retrieval augmented generation to provide students with a socratic questioning framework using their notes or lecture transcripts.
2. **Triton Tutor** - A chrome extension that connects to the UCSD podcast website and allows you to ask questions about a specific lecture (Powered by OpenAI API).
3. **Skin Lesion Detector** - A series of computer vision models (built with OpenCV and PyTorch) that detect skin lesions given an image.

## Interesting Code Snippet:

Here's a cool function (Found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm)):

```c
void XorSwap(int *x, int *y) 
{
  if (x == y) return;
  *x ^= *y;
  *y ^= *x;
  *x ^= *y;
}
```

## CSE 110 To-Do List:
